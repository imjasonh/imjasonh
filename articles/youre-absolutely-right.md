# "You're Absolutely Right!"

There exists a type of person that secretly believes they're right in most cases. They're smart, they know their stuff, they've always scored well on tests, and in general they're probably relatively successful. The proof is in the pudding.

There exists another type of person that secretly believes they're always messing something up. They're missing some important detail, making a critical assumption that will prove to be their downfall. This doesn't mean they're unsuccessful, but any success they have is, according to their inner monologue, _despite_ their fatal flaws, and not _because_ they bring something special to the table.

While you're reading this, you might already have a mental picture of a person who you consider the former or the latter. You might personally relate to one or the other.

At a basic level, these two types of people, when confronted with agreement from an outside party, have two different reactions:

1. Of course I'm right, I'm glad you finally came around and I'm annoyed it took so long.
2. Wait what? Are you even dumber than me? _Palpable skepticism_.

When confronted with repeated, slavish, sycophantic agreement, the result likewise multiplies:

1. Of course I'm absolutely right! I'm the most briliant motherfucker that's ever existed.
2. Oh I get it, you're an idiot. Back to work.

### It's obviously an AI post

I believe this exercise explains in part why AI has become such a phenomenon. LLMs are designed to be positive, agreeable, and collaborative. Outright sycophancy is endemic, to the point of cliché.

The first group of people, who I'm willing to say are likely over-represented in the proverbial "C-suite", love it and eat it up. They sell it to their C-suite friends, who naturally also eat it up.

The second group of people tend to end up getting labeled as "AI skeptics", and some even self-identify, but I think this is a misunderstanding. They're positivity skeptics. Agreement skeptics. Self-skeptics. They were a lost cause the first time they saw an LLM say "you're absolutely right!" — it doesn't even matter what the question was, there's no way that's true.

In both cases, biases are sticky, and by now it's too late for most of them.

The truth is, as always, more complicated. A normal person during the course of a week or day or even a single meeting can be sure they're right one minute, and be sure they're the dumbest idiot on earth the next. We contain multitudes.

And whether we're endlessly sure of ourselves, or endlessly self-skeptical, we're wrong. This was true before LLMs and it'll be true right up until our AI overlords put us in the meat farms and harvest to body heat (on track for Q3 2027)

### The secret third kind

There's a third kind of person, who hasn't decided whether to be sure of themselves or not. They're students, young professionals, and even adolescents and little children. Some of them don't even know they need to decide.

These soft-brained youngins are where this AI thing really makes its mark, because their reaction to LLMs is still up in the air.

AI Doomers might say the kids are cooked, and that an endless pipeline of generated positivity slop beamed directly into their lil' noggins will produce a generation of cocksure assholes, doped up on the intoxicating high of being told they're infallible.

But maybe it's good to tell kids to believe in themselves, actually? To get them over the hump of self-skepticism and see what's on the other side. They'll fail, and hopefully try again, and learn something.

### What was this all about anyway?

If you have a strong negative or positive opinion of LLMs, _you are absolutely wrong._

This is a large enough and new enough technology that nobody on earth has enough data about its impact on society and our planet to speak authoritatively. And, like all technology, there isn't even a right answer. Are cars "good"? Is a screwdriver a net positive? How about agriculture? Ponder this long enough and you'll end up with a degree in Philosophy. And nobody wants that.
